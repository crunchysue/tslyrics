<body>In the heat of the fight I walked away<br />
Ignoring words that you were saying<br />
Trying to make me stay<br />

I said, 'This time I've had enough'<br />
And you've called a hundred times<br />
But I'm not picking up<br />
Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over<br />
But if you look a little closer<br />
<br />
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you<br />
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles<br />
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'<br />

Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more<br />
And don't you leave cause I know<br />
All I need is on the other side of the door<br />
<br />
Me and my stupid pride, sitting here alone<br />
I'm going through the photographs<br />
Staring at the phone<br />
I keep going back over, things that let us down<br />
And I remember the slamming door<br />

And all the things that I misread<br />
So baby if you know everything<br />
Tell me why you couldn't see<br />
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me<br />
<br />
Yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you<br />
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles<br />
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'<br />
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more<br />

And don't you leave cause I know<br />
All I need is on the other side of the door<br />
<br />
And I'll scream out the window<br />
I can't even look at you<br />
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do<br />
I say, "There's nothing you can say to make this right<br />
I mean it, I mean it"<br />
What I mean I<br />

<br />
I said, "Leave," but baby all I want is you<br />
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles<br />
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'<br />
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more<br />
And don't you leave cause I know<br />
All I need is on the other side of the door<br />
<br />
With your face and the beautiful eyes<br />
And the conversation with the little white lies<br />

And the faded picture of a beautiful night<br />
You carry me from your car to the stairs<br />
And I broke down crying, wish it weren't this mess<br />
After everything and that little black dress<br />
After everything I must confess, I need you
