<body>She can't see the way your eyes light up when you smile<br />
She'll never notice how you stop and stare whenever she walks by<br />
And you can't see me wantin you the way you want her<br />
But you are everything to me<br />

<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
And I just wanna show you<br />
She don't even know you<br />
She's never gonna love you like I want to<br />
You just see right through me but if you only knew me<br />
We could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable instead of just invisible<br />
<br />
There's a fire inside of you that can't help but shine through<br />
She's never gonna see the light<br />

No matter what you do<br />
And all I think about is how to make you think of me<br />
And everything that we could be<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
Like shadows in a faded light<br />
Oh we're Invisible<br />
I just wanna look in your eyes and make you realize<br />
<br />

I just wanna show you she don't even know you<br />
Baby let me love you let me want you<br />
You just see right through me<br />
But if you only knew me<br />
We could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable instead of just invisible<br />
<br />
She can't see the way your eyes light up when you smile
