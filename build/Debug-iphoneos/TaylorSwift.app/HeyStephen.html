<body>Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving but I know I saw a light in you<br />
As we walked we were talking and I didn't say half the things I wanted to<br />
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window<br />

I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold<br />
Hey Stephen, boy you might have me believing I don't always have to be alone.<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
'cause I can't help it if you look like an angel<br />
Can't help I if I wanna kiss you in the rain so<br />
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you<br />
Can't help it if there's no one else<br />
I can't help myself<br />

<br />
Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling<br />
So I've got some things to say to you<br />
I seen it all so I thought but I never seen nobody shine the way you do<br />
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name<br />
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change<br />
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving<br />
I think you and I should stay the same<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />

<br />
They're dimming the street lights<br />
You're perfect for me why aren't you here tonight?<br />
I'm waiting alone now so come on and come out and pull me near<br />
Shine, shine, shine<br />
<br />
Hey Stephen I could give you fifty reasons why I should be the one you choose<br />
All those other girls, well they're beautiful but would they write a song for you<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br />

<br />
Myself, can't help myself<br />
I can't help myself.

<br />
