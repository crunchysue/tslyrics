He said the way my blue eyes shined<br />
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night<br />
I said: "That's a lie."<br />
Just a boy in a Chevy truck<br />

That had a tendency of gettin' stuck<br />
On backroads at night<br />
And I was right there beside him all summer long<br />
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone<br />
<br />
But when you think Tim McGraw<br />
I hope you think my favorite song<br />
The one we danced to all night long<br />
The moon like a spotlight on the lake<br />

When you think happiness<br />
I hope you think that little black dress<br />
Think of my head on your chest<br />
And my old faded blue jeans<br />
When you think Tim McGraw<br />
I hope you think of me<br />
<br />
September saw a month of tears<br />
And thankin' God that you weren't here<br />

To see me like that<br />
But in a box beneath my bed<br />
Is a letter that you never read<br />
From three summers back<br />
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet<br />
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe<br />
<br />
When you think Tim McGraw<br />
I hope you think my favorite song<br />

The one we danced to all night long<br />
The moon like a spotlight on the lake<br />
When you think happiness<br />
I hope you think that little black dress<br />
Think of my head on your chest<br />
And my old faded blue jeans<br />
When you think Tim McGraw<br />
I hope you think of me<br />
<br />

And I'm back for the first time since then<br />
I'm standin' on your street<br />
And there's a letter left on your doorstep<br />
And the first thing that you'll read is:<br />
<br />
When you think Tim McGraw<br />
I hope you think my favorite song<br />
Someday you'll turn your radio on<br />
I hope it takes you back to that place<br />

When you think happiness<br />
I hope you think that little black dress<br />
Think of my head on your chest<br />
And my old faded blue jeans<br />
When you think Tim McGraw<br />
I hope you think of me<br />
<br />
Oh, think of me<br />
Mmmm<br />

<br />
He said the way my blue eyes shine<br />
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night<br />
I said: "That's a lie"
