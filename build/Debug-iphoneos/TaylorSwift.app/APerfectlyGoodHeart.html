<body><i>[Chorus 1:]</i><br />
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?<br />
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?<br />
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?<br />

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?<br />
<br />
Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.<br />
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall.<br />
No matter what you say, I still can't believe<br />
That you would walk away.<br />
It don't make sense to me, but:<br />
<br />
<i>[Repeat Chorus 1:]</i><br />
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?<br />

Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?<br />
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?<br />
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?<br />
<br />
It's not unbroken anymore.<br />
How do I get it back the way it was before?<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus 2:]</i><br />
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?<br />
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?<br />

Why would you wanna make the very first scar?<br />
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:<br />
<br />
<i>[Repeat Chorus 1:]</i><br />
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?<br />
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?<br />
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?<br />
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
