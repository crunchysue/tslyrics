<body>Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty<br />
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you<br />
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty<br />
But that's not true, cause I know you...<br />

<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
<br />
Hold on, baby, you're losing it<br />
The water's high, you're jumping into it<br />
And letting go... and no one knows<br />
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone<br />
That you might not be the golden one<br />
And you're tied together with a smile<br />
But you're coming undone<br />

<br />
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted<br />
Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change<br />
Hoping it will end up in his pocket<br />
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain<br />
Oh, cause it's not his price to pay<br />
Not his price to pay...<br />
<br />
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br />
<br />

You're tied together with a smile<br />
But you're coming undone... oh<br />
Goodbye, baby<br />
Goodbye, baby<br />
With a smile, baby, baby
