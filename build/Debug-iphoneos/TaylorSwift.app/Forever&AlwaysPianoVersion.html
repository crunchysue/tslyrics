<body>Once upon a time<br />

I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye<br />
And we caught onto something<br />
I hold onto the night<br />
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me<br />
Were you just kidding cause it seems to me<br />
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak<br />
I don't feel welcome anymore<br />
Baby, what happened, please tell me<br />
Cause one second it was perfect<br />

Now you're half way out the door<br />
<br />
And I stare at the phone<br />
He still hasn't called<br />
And then you feel so low<br />
You can't feel nothing at all<br />
And you flashback to<br />
When he said forever and always<br />
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom<br />

Everything is wrong<br />
It rains when you're here<br />
And it rains when you're gone<br />
I was there when you said forever and always<br />
<br />
Was I out of line?<br />
Did I say something way too honest?<br />
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy<br />
I looked into your eyes<br />

Thought I knew for a minute now I'm not so sure<br />
So here's to everything coming down to nothing<br />
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core<br />
Where is this going?<br />
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore<br />
<br />
And I stare at the phone<br />
He still hasn't called<br />
And then you feel so low<br />

You can't feel nothing at all<br />
And you flashback to<br />
When he said forever and always<br />
And it rains in your bedroom<br />
Everything is wrong<br />
It rains when you're here<br />
And it rains when you're gone<br />
I was there when you said forever and always<br />
<br />

You didn't mean it baby<br />
I don't this so, oh oh oh<br />
Back up, baby back up<br />
Did you forget everything?<br />
Back up, baby back up<br />
Did you forget everything?<br />
<br />
Back up, baby back up<br />
Please back up, oh back up<br />

Back up, baby back up<br />
<br />
Cause it rains in your bedroom<br />
Everything is wrong<br />
It rains when you're here<br />
And it rains when you're gone<br />
I was there when you said forever and always<br />
<br />
And I stare at the phone<br />
He still hasn't called<br />

And then you feel so low<br />
You can't feel nothing at all<br />
And you flashback to<br />
When we said forever and always<br />
Cause it rains in your bedroom<br />
Everything is wrong<br />
It rains when you're here<br />
And it rains when you're gone<br />
I was there when you said forever and always<br />

<br />
You didn't mean it baby<br />
You said forever and always, yeah
