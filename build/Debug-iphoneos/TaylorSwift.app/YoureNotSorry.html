<body>All this time I was wasting,<br />
Hoping you would come around<br />
I've been giving out chances every time<br />

And all you do is let me down<br />
And it's taking me this long<br />
Baby but I figured you out<br />
And you're thinking we'll be fine again,<br />
But not this time around<br />
<br />
You don't have to call anymore<br />
I won't pick up the phone<br />
This is the last straw<br />

Don't wanna hurt anymore<br />
And you can tell me that you're sorry<br />
But I don't believe you baby<br />
Like I did - before<br />
You're not sorry, no no oh<br />
<br />
Looking so innocent,<br />
I might believe you if I didn't know<br />
Could've loved you all my life<br />

If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold<br />
And you got your share of secrets<br />
And I'm tired of being last to know<br />
And now you're asking me to listen<br />
Cause it's worked each time before<br />
<br />
But you don't have to call anymore<br />
I won't pick up the phone<br />
This is the last straw<br />

Don't wanna hurt anymore<br />
And you can tell me that you're sorry<br />
But I don't believe you baby<br />
Like I did - before<br />
You're not sorry, no no, oh<br />
<br />
You're not sorry no no oh<br />
<br />
You had me crawling for you honey<br />
And it never would've gone away, no<br />

You used to shine so bright<br />
But I watched all of it fade<br />
<br />
So you don't have to call anymore<br />
I won't pick up the phone<br />
This is the last straw<br />
There's nothing left to beg for<br />
And you can tell me that you're sorry<br />
But I don't believe you baby<br />

Like I did - before<br />
You're not sorry, no no oh<br />
<br />
You're not sorry, no no oh
