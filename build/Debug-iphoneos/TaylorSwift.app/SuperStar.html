<body>This is wrong but I can't help but feel like<br />
There ain't nothing more out there<br />
Misty morning come again and I can't<br />
Help but wish I could see your face<br />
And I knew from the first time I paid<br />
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you<br />
You smile that beautiful smile and<br />
All the girls in the front row scream your name<br />

<br />
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like<br />
I can't take my eyes off of you<br />
I'm no one special, just another<br />
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you<br />
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar<br />
<br />
Morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not<br />
Dreaming about you<br />
When my world wakes up today<br />

You'll be in another town<br />
And I knew when I say your face, I'd be<br />
Counting down the ways to see you<br />
You smile that beautiful smile and<br />
All the girls in the front row scream your name<br />
<br />
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like<br />
I can't take my eyes off of you<br />
I'm no one special, just another<br />

Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you<br />
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar<br />
<br />
You played in bars, you play guitar<br />
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are<br />
And you'll never see, sing me to sleep<br />
Every night from the radio<br />
<br />
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like<br />
I can't take my eyes off of you<br />

I'm no one special, just another<br />
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you<br />
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar<br />
Sweet, sweet superstar, superstar
