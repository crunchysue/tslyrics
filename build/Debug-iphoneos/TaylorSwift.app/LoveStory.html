<body>We were both young, when I first saw you.<br />
I close my eyes and the flashback starts-<br />
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.<br />

<br />
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.<br />
I see you make your way through the crowd-<br />
You say hello, little did I know...<br />
<br />
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-<br />
And my daddy said "stay away from Juliet"-<br />
And I was crying on the staircase-<br />
begging you, "Please don't go..."<br />
And I said...<br />

<br />
Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.<br />
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.<br />
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,<br />
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.<br />
<br />
So I sneak out to the garden to see you.<br />
We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-<br />
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.<br />
Oh, Oh.<br />

<br />
Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,<br />
And my daddy said "stay away from Juliet" -<br />
but you were everything to me-<br />
I was begging you, "Please don't go"<br />
And I said...<br />
<br />
Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.<br />
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.<br />
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.<br />

It's a love story, baby, just say yes-<br />
<br />
Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.<br />
This love is difficult, but it's real.<br />
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.<br />
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.<br />
Oh, Oh.<br />
<br />
I got tired of waiting.<br />
Wondering if you were ever coming around.<br />

My faith in you was fading-<br />
When I met you on the outskirts of town.<br />
And I said...<br />
<br />
Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.<br />
I keep waiting, for you but you never come.<br />
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-<br />
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...<br />
<br />
Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.<br />

I love you, and that's all I really know.<br />
I talked to your dad -- go pick out a white dress<br />
It's a love story, baby just say... yes.<br />
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.<br />
<br />
'cause we were both young when I first saw you
