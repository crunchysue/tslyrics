<body>I don't know what I want, so don't ask me<br />
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out<br />
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking<br />
Trying to see through the rain coming down<br />

Even though I'm not the only one<br />
Who feels the way I do<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
<br />
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know<br />
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on<br />
I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in<br />
This world<br />
<br />

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans<br />
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve<br />
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine<br />
Could you tell me what more do I need<br />
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah<br />
But that's ok<br />
<br />
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission<br />

But I'm ready to fly<br />
<br />
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i>
