<body>I see your face in my mind as I drive away, <br />
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way. <br />
People are people, <br />

And sometimes we change our minds. <br />
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time. <br />
<br />
Mmm mmm mmm <br />
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm <br />
Mmm mmm mmm <br />
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm <br />
<br />
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie, <br />
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see. <br />

Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down, <br />
Now I don't know what to be without you around. <br />
<br />
And we know it's never simple, <br />
Never easy. <br />
Never a clean break, noone here to save me. <br />
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand, <br />
And I can't, <br />
Breathe, <br />

Without you, <br />
But I have to, <br />
Breathe, <br />
Without you, <br />
But I have to. <br />
<br />
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt. <br />
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve. <br />
But people are people, <br />

And sometimes it doesn't work out, <br />
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out. <br />
<br />
And we know it's never simple, <br />
Never easy. <br />
Never a clean break, no one here to save me. <br />
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand, <br />
And I can't, <br />
Breathe, <br />

Without you, <br />
But I have to, <br />
Breathe, <br />
Without you, <br />
But I have to. <br />
<br />
It's two a.m. <br />
Feelin' like I just lost a friend. <br />
Hope you know it's not easy, <br />

Easy for me. <br />
It's two a.m. <br />
Feelin' like I just lost a friend. <br />
Hope you know this ain't easy, <br />
Easy for me. <br />
<br />
And we know it's never simple, <br />
Never easy. <br />
Never a clean break, noone here to save me. <br />

<br />
Ohhh <br />
<br />
I can't, <br />
Breathe, <br />
Without you, <br />
But I have to, <br />
Breathe, <br />
Without you, <br />
But I have to. <br />

<br />
Sorry (oh) Sorry (mmm) <br />
Sorry (eh eh) Sorry (mmm) <br />
Sorry (eh eh) Sorry (mmm) <br />
Sorry
