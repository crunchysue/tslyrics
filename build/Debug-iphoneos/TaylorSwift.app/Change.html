<body>And it’s a sad picture, the final blow hits you<br />
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and<br />
You know it’s all the same, another time and place<br />

Repeating history and you’re getting sick of it<br />
But I believe in whatever you do<br />
And I’ll do anything to see it through<br />
<br />
Because these things will change<br />
Can you feel it now?<br />
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down<br />
This revolution, the time will come<br />
For us to finally win<br />

And we’ll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah<br />
<br />
So we’ve been outnumbered<br />
Raided and now cornered<br />
It’s hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair<br />
We’re getting stronger now<br />
Find things they never found<br />
They might be bigger<br />
But we’re faster and never scared<br />

You can walk away, say we don’t need this<br />
But there’s something in your eyes<br />
Says we can beat this<br />
<br />
Because these things will change<br />
Can you feel it now?<br />
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down<br />
This revolution, the time will come<br />
For us to finally win<br />

And we’ll sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah<br />
<br />
Tonight we stand, get off our knees<br />
Fight for what we’ve worked for all these years<br />
And the battle was long, it’s the fight of our lives<br />
But we’ll stand up champions tonight<br />
<br />
It was the night things changed<br />
Can you see it now?<br />
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down<br />

It’s a revolution, throw your hands up<br />
Cause we never gave in<br />
And we sang hallelujah, we sang hallelujah<br />
Hallelujah
