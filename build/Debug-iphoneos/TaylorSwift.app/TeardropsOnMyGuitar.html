Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see<br />
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be<br />
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about<br />
And she's got everything that I have to live without<br />

<br />
Drew talks to me, I laugh cause it's just so funny<br />
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me<br />
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,<br />
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
<br />
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar<br />
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star<br />

He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do<br />
<br />
Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?<br />
And there he goes, so perfectly,<br />
The kind of flawless I wish I could be<br />
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love<br />
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause<br />
<br />
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br />
<br />

So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light<br />
I'll put his picture down and maybe<br />
Get some sleep tonight<br />
<br />
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar<br />
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart<br />
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do<br />
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough<br />
And he's all that I need to fall into..<br />

<br />
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see.
