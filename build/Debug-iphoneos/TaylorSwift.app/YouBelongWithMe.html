<body>You're on the phone<br>
With your girlfriend<br>
She's upset<br>
She's going off about<br>
Something that you said<br>
'cause she doesn't get your humor<br>
Like I do<br>
<br>
I'm in the room<br>

It's a typical Tuesday night<br>
I'm listening to the kind of music<br>
She doesn't like<br>
She'll never know your story<br>
Like I do<br>
<br>
But she wears short skirts<br>
I wear t-shirts<br>
She's cheer captain<br>

And I'm on the bleachers<br>
Dreaming about the day<br>
When you wake up and find<br>
That what you're looking for<br>
Has been here the whole time<br>
<br>
If you could see<br>
That I'm the one<br>
Who understands you<br>

Been here all along<br>
So why can't you<br>
See you belong with me<br>
You belong with me.<br>
<br>
Walking the streets<br>
With you and your worn out jeans<br>
I can't help thinking<br>
This is how it ought to be<br>

Laughing on a park bench<br>
Thinking to myself<br>
Hey, isn't this easy?<br>
<br>
And you've got a smile<br>
That could light up this whole town<br>
I haven't seen it in awhile<br>
Since she brought you down<br>
You say you're fine<br>

I know you better than that<br>
Hey what you doing<br>
With a girl like that<br>
<br>
She wears high heels<br>
I wear sneakers<br>
She's cheer captain<br>
I'm on the bleachers<br>
Dreaming about the day<br>

When you wake up and find<br>
That what you're looking for<br>
Has been here the whole time<br>
<br>
If you could see<br>
That I'm the one<br>
Who understands you<br>
Been here all along<br>
So why can't you<br>

See you belong with me<br>
Standing by and<br>
Waiting at your backdoor<br>
All this time<br>
How could you not know<br>
Baby<br>
You belong with me<br>
You belong with me.<br>
<br>

<i>[Instrumental]</i><br>
<br>
Oh, I remember<br>
You driving to my house<br>
In the middle of the night<br>
I'm the one who makes you laugh<br>
When you know you're about to cry<br>
And I know your favorite songs<br>
And you tell me about your dreams<br>

Think I know where you belong<br>
Think I know it's with me<br>
<br>
Can't you see<br>
That I'm the one<br>
Who understands<br>
Been here all along<br>
So why can't you see?<br>
You belong with me.<br>

<br>
Have you ever thought<br>
Just maybe<br>
You belong with me?</body></html>
