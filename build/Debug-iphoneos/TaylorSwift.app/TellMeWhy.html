<body>I took a chance, I took a shot <br />

And you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not <br />
You took a swing, I took it hard <br />
And down here from the ground I see who you are <br />
<br />
I'm sick and tired of your attitude <br />
I'm feeling like I don't know you <br />
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down <br />
And I need you like a heartbeat <br />
But you know you got a mean streak <br />

Makes me run for cover when you're around <br />
And here's to you and your temper <br />
Yes, I remember what you said last night <br />
And I know that you see what you're doing to me <br />
Tell me why.. <br />
<br />
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day <br />
Well I get so confused and frustrated <br />
Forget what i'm trying to say, oh <br />

<br />
I'm sick and tired of your reasons <br />
I got no one to believe in <br />
You tell me that you want me, then push me around <br />
And I need you like a heartbeat <br />
But you know you got a mean streak <br />
Makes me run for cover when you're around <br />
Here's to you and your temper <br />
Yes, I remember what you said last night <br />

And I know that you see what you're doing to me <br />
Tell me why.. <br />
<br />
Why..do you have to make me feel small <br />
So you can feel whole inside <br />
Why..do you have to put down my dreams <br />
So you're the only thing on my mind <br />
<br />
I'm sick and tired of your attitude <br />
I'm feeling like I don't know you <br />

You tell me that you want me then cut me down <br />
I'm sick and tired of your reasons <br />
I've got no one to believe in <br />
You ask me for my love then you push me around <br />
Here's to you and your temper <br />
Yes, I remember what you said last night <br />
And I know that you see what you're doing to me <br />
Tell me why <br />
Why, tell me why <br />

<br />
I take a step back, let you go <br />
I told you i'm not bulletproof <br />
Now you know
