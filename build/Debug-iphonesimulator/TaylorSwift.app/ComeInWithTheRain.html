<body>I could go back to every laugh,<br />
But I don't wanna' go there anymore,<br />
And I know all the steps up to your door,<br />

But I don't wanna' go there anymore.<br />
<br />
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky,<br />
Talk to the man with the reasons why,<br />
And let me know what you find.<br />
<br />
I’ll leave my window open,<br />
‘Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name.<br />
Just know I’m right here hopin’,<br />
That you’ll come in with the rain.<br />

<br />
I could stand up and sing you a song,<br />
But I don’t wanna’ have to go that far.<br />
And I, I’ve got you down,<br />
I know you by heart,<br />
And you don’t even know where I start.<br />
<br />
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears,<br />
Talk to the man who put you here,<br />
And don’t wait for the sky to clear.<br />

<br />
I’ll leave my window open,<br />
‘Cus I’m too tired at night to call your name.<br />
Oh, just know I’m right here hopin’,<br />
That you’ll come in with the rain.<br />
<br />
I’ve watched you so long,<br />
Screamed your name,<br />
I don’t know what else I can say.<br />
<br />

But I’ll leave my window open,<br />
‘Cus I’m too tired at night for all these games.<br />
Just know I’m right here hopin’,<br />
That you’ll come in with the rain.<br />
<br />
I could go back to every laugh,<br />
But I don’t wanna’ go there anymore…
