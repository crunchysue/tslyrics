<body>There's somethin' 'bout the way<br />
The street looks when it's just rained<br />
There's a glow off the pavement<br />

Walk me to the car<br />
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there<br />
In the middle of the parking lot<br />
Yeah<br />
Oh yeah<br />
<br />
We're drivin' down the road<br />
I wonder if you know<br />
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now<br />

But you're just so cool<br />
Run your hands through your hair<br />
Absent mindedly makin' me want you<br />
<br />
And I don't know how it gets better than this<br />
You take my hand and drag me head first<br />
Fearless<br />
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress<br />
Fearless<br />

<br />
So baby drive slow<br />
'til we run out of road in this one horse town<br />
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat<br />
You put your eyes on me<br />
In this moment now capture it, remember it<br />
<br />
Cause I don't know how it gets better than this<br />
You take my hand and drag me head first<br />
Fearless<br />

And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress<br />
Fearless<br />
<br />
Well you stood there with me in the doorway<br />
My hands shake<br />
I'm not usually this way but<br />
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave<br />
It's the first kiss,<br />
It's flawless,<br />

Really something,<br />
It's fearless.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah<br />
And I don't know how it gets better than this<br />
You take my hand and drag me head first<br />
Fearless<br />
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress<br />
Fearless<br />

<br />
Yeah<br />
I don't know how<br />
Oh yeah yeah
