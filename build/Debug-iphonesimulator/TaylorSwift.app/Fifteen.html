<body>You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors<br />
It's the morning of your very first day<br />
You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while<br />

Try and stay out of everybody's way<br />
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here<br />
For the next four years in this town<br />
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say<br />
"You know I haven't seen you around, before"<br />
<br />
'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you<br />
You're gonna believe them<br />
And when you're fifteen<br />

Feeling like there nothing to figure out<br />
Well count to ten, take it in<br />
This is life before who you're gonna be<br />
Fifteen<br />
<br />
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail<br />
And soon enough you're best friends<br />
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool<br />
Well be out of here as soon as we can<br />

And then you're on your very first date and hes got a car<br />
And you're feeling like flying<br />
And you're mommas waiting up and you think hes the one<br />
And you're dancing round your room when the night end<br />
When the night ends<br />
<br />
'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tell you they love you<br />
You're gonna believe them<br />
When you're fifteen and your first kiss<br />

Makes your head spin round but<br />
In your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team<br />
But I didn't know it at fifteen<br />
<br />
When all you wanted was to be wanted<br />
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now<br />
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday<br />
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine<br />
<br />
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy<br />

Who changed his mind and we both cried<br />
<br />
'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you<br />
You're gonna believe them<br />
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall<br />
Ive found that time can heal most anything<br />
And you just might find who you're supposed to be<br />
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen<br />
<br />
La la la la la .. la la la la la .. La la la la la<br />

<br />
Your very first day<br />
Take a deep breath girl<br />
Take a deep breath as you walk through those doors.
