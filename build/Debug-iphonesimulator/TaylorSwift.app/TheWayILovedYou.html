<body>He is sensible and so incredible <br />
And all my single friends are jealous <br />
He says everything I need to hear and it's like <br />
I couldn't ask for anything better <br />

He opens up my door and I get into his car <br />
And he says you look beautiful tonight <br />
And I feel perfectly fine <br />
<br />
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain <br />
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name <br />
You're so in love that you act insane <br />
And that's the way I loved you <br />
Breakin' down and coming undone <br />

It's a roller coaster kinda rush <br />
And I never knew I could feel that much <br />
And that's the way I loved you <br />
<br />
He respects my space <br />
And never makes me wait <br />
And he calls exactly when he says he will <br />
He's close to my mother <br />
Talks business with my father <br />

He's charming and endearing <br />
And I'm comfortable <br />
<br />
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain <br />
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name <br />
You're so in love that you act insane <br />
And that's the way I loved you <br />
Breakin' down and coming undone <br />
It's a roller coaster kinda rush <br />

And I never knew I could feel that much <br />
And that's the way I loved you <br />
<br />
He can't see the smile I'm faking <br />
And my heart's not breaking <br />
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all <br />
And you were wild and crazy <br />
Just so frustrating intoxicating <br />
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now <br />

<br />
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain <br />
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name <br />
I'm so in love that I acted insane <br />
And that's the way I loved you <br />
Breaking down and coming undone <br />
It's a roller coaster kinda rush <br />
And I never knew I could feel that much <br />
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh <br />

<br />
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh <br />
Never knew I could feel that much <br />
And that's the way I loved you
