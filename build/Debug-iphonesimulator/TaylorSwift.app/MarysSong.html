<body>She said, I was seven and you were nine<br />
I looked at you like the stars that shined<br />
In the sky, the pretty lights<br />
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us<br />

Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled<br />
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my<br />
<br />
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree<br />
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me<br />
You never did, you never did<br />
Take me back when our world was one block wide<br />
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried<br />
Just two kids, you and I...<br />

Oh my my my my<br />
<br />
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly<br />
I wasn't that little girl you used to see<br />
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights<br />
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us<br />
They never believed we'd really fall in love<br />
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes<br />
And said oh my my my...<br />

<br />
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up<br />
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me<br />
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight<br />
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight<br />
You stayed outside till the morning light<br />
Oh my my my my<br />
<br />
A few years had gone and come around<br />
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town<br />

And you looked at me, got down on one knee<br />
<br />
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle<br />
Our whole town came and our mamas cried<br />
You said I do and I did too<br />
Take me home where we met so many years before<br />
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch<br />
After all this time, you and I<br />
<br />
I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine<br />

I'll still look at you like the stars that shine<br />
In the sky, oh my my my...
