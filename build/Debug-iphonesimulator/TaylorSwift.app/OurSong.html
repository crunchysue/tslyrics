<body>I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car<br />
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel<br />
The other on my heart<br />
I look around, turn the radio down<br />

He says baby is something wrong?<br />
I say nothing I was just thinking how we don't have a song<br />
And he says...<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
Our song is the slamming screen doors,<br />
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window<br />
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow<br />
'cause it's late and your mama don't know<br />

Our song is the way you laugh<br />
The first date "man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"<br />
And when I got home ... before I said amen<br />
Asking God if he could play it again<br />
<br />
I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day<br />
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on<br />
And lost and thrown away<br />
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed<br />

I almost didn't notice all the roses<br />
And the note that said...<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
I've heard every album, listened to the radio<br />
Waited for something to come along<br />
That was as good as our song...<br />
<br />
Cause<br />

<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone<br />
In the front seat of his car<br />
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin<br />
And I wrote down our song
