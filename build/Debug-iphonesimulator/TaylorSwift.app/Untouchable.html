<body>Untouchable like a distant diamond sky, Mmmm<br />
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why<br />
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you<br />
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun<br />

And when you're close I feel like coming undone<br />
<br />
In the middle of the night<br />
When I'm in this dream<br />
It's like a million little stars<br />
Spelling out your name<br />
You gotta come on, come on<br />
Say that we'll be together<br />
Come on, come on<br />

Little taste of Heaven<br />
<br />
It's half full and I won't wait here all day<br />
I know you're saying that you'll be here anyway<br />
But you're untouchable<br />
Burning brighter than the sun<br />
Now that you're closer, feel like coming undone<br />
<br />
In the middle of the night<br />
When I'm in this dream<br />

It's like a million little stars<br />
Spelling out your name<br />
You gotta come on, come on<br />
Say that we'll be together<br />
Come on, come on<br />
<br />
Oh, In the middle of the night<br />
We could form this dream<br />
I wanna feel you by my side<br />

Standing next to me<br />
You gotta come on, come on<br />
Say that we'll be together<br />
Come on, come on<br />
Little taste of Heaven<br />
<br />
Oh, oh I'm caught up in you<br />
Oh, oh, oh<br />
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun<br />

And when you're close I feel like coming undone<br />
<br />
In the middle of the night<br />
When I'm in this dream<br />
It's like a million little stars<br />
Spelling out your name<br />
You gotta come on, come on<br />
Say that we'll be together<br />
Come on, come on, oh oh <br />

<br />
Oh, Oh, In the middle of the night<br />
We could form this dream<br />
I wanna feel you by my side<br />
Standing next to me<br />
You gotta come on, come on<br />
Say that we'll be together<br />
Come on, come on<br />
Little taste of Heaven
