<body>I like the way you sound in the morning<br />
We're on the phone and without a warning<br />
I realize your laugh is the best sound <br />
I have ever heard<br />

<br />
I like the way I can't keep my focus<br />
I watch you talk, you didn't notice<br />
I hear the words but all I can think is<br />
We should be together<br />
Every time you smile, I smile<br />
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you<br />
<br />
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you baby<br />
Don't be afraid to<br />

Jump then fall<br />
Jump then fall into me<br />
Be there, never gonna leave you<br />
Say that you wanna be with me too<br />
So I'm a stay through it all<br />
So jump then fall<br />
<br />
I like the way your hair falls in your face<br />
You got the keys to me <br />

I love each freckle on your face, oh<br />
I've never been so wrapped up, honey<br />
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted<br />
<br />
I had time to think it oh, over<br />
And all I can say is come closer<br />
Take a deep breath then jump then fall into me<br />
Cause Every time you smile, I smile<br />
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you<br />

<br />
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you baby<br />
Don't be afraid to<br />
Jump then fall<br />
Jump then fall into me<br />
Be there, never gonna leave you<br />
Say that you wanna be with me too<br />
So I'm a stay through it all<br />
So jump then fall<br />

<br />
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet<br />
I'll catch you, I'll catch you<br />
And people say things that bring you to your knees<br />
I'll catch you<br />
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry<br />
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile<br />
<br />
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you baby<br />
Don't be afraid, please<br />

Jump then fall<br />
Jump then fall into me<br />
Be there, never gonna leave you<br />
Say that you wanna be with me too<br />
So I'm a stay through it all<br />
So jump then fall<br />
Jump then fall baby<br />
Jump then fall into me, into me<br />
<br />

Every time you smile, I smile<br />
And every time you shine, I shine<br />
And every time you're here<br />
Baby I'll show you, I'll show you<br />
You can Jump then fall, jump then fall<br />
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah
