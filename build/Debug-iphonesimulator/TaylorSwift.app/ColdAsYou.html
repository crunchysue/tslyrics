<body>You have a way of coming easily to me<br />
And when you take, you take the very best of me<br />
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something<br />
And you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted<br />

<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
<br />
Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day<br />
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say<br />
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through<br />
I've never been anywhere cold as you<br />
<br />
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray<br />
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away<br />

And you come away with a great little story<br />
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you<br />
<br />
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you<br />
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you<br />
(Died for you)<br />
<br />
Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day<br />

Every smile you fake is so condescending<br />
Counting all the scars you made<br />
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through<br />
I've never been anywhere cold as you
