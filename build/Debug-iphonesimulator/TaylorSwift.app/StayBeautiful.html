<body>Cory's eyes are like a jungle<br />
He smiles, it's like the radio<br />
He whispers songs into my window<br />
In words nobody knows<br />

There's pretty girls on every corner<br />
That watch him as he's walking home<br />
Saying, does he know<br />
Will you ever know<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
You're beautiful<br />
Every little piece love, don't you know<br />
You're really gonna be someone, ask anyone<br />

When you find everything you looked for<br />
I hope your life leads you back to my door<br />
Oh but if it don't, stay beautiful<br />
<br />
Cory finds another way to be<br />
The highlight of my day<br />
I'm taking pictures in my mind<br />
So I can save them for a rainy day<br />
It's hard to make conversation<br />

When he's taking my breath away<br />
I should say, hey by the way<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
If you and I are a story<br />
That never gets told<br />
If what you are is a daydream<br />
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know<br />
<br />

You're beautiful every little piece love,<br />
and don't you know your really gonna be someone ask anyone.<br />
and when you find everything you looked for,<br />
I hope your life leads you back to my front door.<br />
oh but if it don't will you stay<br />
beautiful beautiful beautiful<br />
beautiful beautiful beautiful<br />
la la la<br />
Oh, oh oh oh,<br />

oh but if it don't,<br />
stay beautiful<br />
stay beautiful<br />
Na na na na na
