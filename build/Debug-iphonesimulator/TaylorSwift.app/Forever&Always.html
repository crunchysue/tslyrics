<body>Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye<br />

And we caught onto something<br />
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me<br />
<br />
Were you just kidding?<br />
'cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down<br />
We almost never speak<br />
I don't feel welcome anymore<br />
Baby what happened, please tell me?<br />
<br />
'cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door<br />

<br />
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called<br />
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all<br />
And you flashback to when he said forever and always<br />
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom<br />
Everything is wrong<br />
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone<br />
Cause I was there when you said forever and always<br />
<br />
Was I out of line?<br />

Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide<br />
Like a scared little boy<br />
I looked into your eyes<br />
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure<br />
<br />
So here's everything coming down to nothing<br />
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core<br />
Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore<br />
<br />
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called<br />

And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all<br />
And you flashback to when he said forever and always<br />
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom<br />
Everything is wrong<br />
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone<br />
'cause I was there when you said forever and always<br />
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so<br />
<br />
Back up, baby, back up<br />

Did you forget everything<br />
Back up, baby, back up<br />
Did you forget everything<br />
<br />
'cause it rains in your bedroom<br />
Everything is wrong<br />
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone<br />
'cause I was there when you said forever and always<br />
<br />
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called<br />

And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all<br />
And you flashback to when we said forever and always<br />
<br />
And it rains in your bedroom<br />
Everything is wrong<br />
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone<br />
'cause I was there when you said forever and always<br />
You didn't mean it baby, you said forever and always I don't think so yeah
