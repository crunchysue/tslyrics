<h1>Picture To Burn</h1>

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy<br />
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me<br />
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy<br />
That's fine I'll tell mine you're gay<br />

And by the way...<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
<br />
I hate that stupid old pickup truck<br />
You never let me drive<br />
You're a redneck heartbreak<br />
Who's really bad at lying<br />
So watch me strike a match<br />
On all my wasted time<br />

As far as I'm concerned you're<br />
Just another picture to burn<br />
<br />
There's no time for tears,<br />
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge<br />
There's nothing stopping me<br />
From going out with all of your best friends<br />
And if you come around saying sorry to me<br />
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be<br />

<br />
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
If you're missing me,<br />
You'd better keep it to yourself<br />
Cause coming back around here<br />
Would be bad for your health...<br />
<br />
I hate that stupid old pickup truck<br />
You never let me drive<br />

You're a redneck heartbreak<br />
Who's really bad at lying<br />
So watch me strike a match<br />
On all my wasted time<br />
In case you haven't heard,<br />
I really really hate that..<br />
<br />
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn<br />

You're just another picture to burn<br />
Baby, burn...
