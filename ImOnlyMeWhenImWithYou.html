<body>Friday night beneath the stars,<br />
in a field behind your yard,<br />
you and I are paintin' pictures in the sky.<br />
And sometimes we don't say a thing;<br />

just listen to the crickets sing.<br />
Everything I need is right here by my side.<br />
And I know everything about you<br />
I don't wanna live without you.<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
I'm only up when you're not down.<br />
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.<br />
It's like no matter what I do.<br />

Well you drive me crazy half the time;<br />
the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.<br />
And I'm only me when I'm with you.<br />
<br />
Just a small town boy and girl<br />
livin' in a crazy world.<br />
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true.<br />
And I don't try to hide my tears.<br />
The secrets or my deepest fears.<br />

Through it all nobody gets me like you do.<br />
And you know everything about me.<br />
You say that you can't live without me.<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself.<br />
Only you can tell.<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />

That I'm only up when you're not down.<br />
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.<br />
It's like no matter what I do.<br />
Well you drive me crazy half the time;<br />
the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.<br />
And I'm only me<br />
Who I wanna be<br />
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you<br />
With you<br />

Uh huh<br />
Yeah
