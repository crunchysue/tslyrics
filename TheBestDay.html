<body>I'm five years old<br />
It's getting cold<br />
I've got my big coat on<br />

<br />
I hear your laugh<br />
And look up smiling at you<br />
I run and run<br />
<br />
Past the pumpkin patch<br />
And the tractor rides<br />
Look now -- the sky is gold<br />
I hug your legs and fall asleep<br />
On the way home<br />

<br />
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall<br />
I know you're not scared of anything at all<br />
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away<br />
But I know I had the best day<br />
With you today<br />
<br />
I'm thirteen now<br />
And don't know how my friends<br />
Could be so mean<br />

<br />
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys<br />
<br />
And we drive and drive<br />
Until we've found a town<br />
Far enough away<br />
<br />
And we talk and window-shop<br />
Until I've forgotten all their names<br />
<br />
I don't know who I'm gonna talk to<br />

Now at school<br />
I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you<br />
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay<br />
But I know I had the best day<br />
With you today<br />
<br />
I have an excellent father<br />
His strength is making me stronger<br />
God smiles on my little brother<br />

Inside and out<br />
He's better than I am<br />
<br />
I grew up in a pretty house<br />
And I had space to run<br />
And I had the best days with you<br />
<br />
There is a video<br />
I found from back when I was three<br />
You set up a paint set in the kitchen<br />

And you're talking to me<br />
<br />
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships<br />
And the seven dwarfs<br />
Daddy's smart<br />
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world<br />
<br />
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall<br />
I know you were on my side<br />
Even when I was wrong<br />

And I love you for giving me your eyes<br />
Staying back and watching me shine<br />
<br />
And I didn't know if you knew<br />
So I'm taking this chance to say<br />
That I had the best day<br />
With you today
