<body>Say you're sorry<br />
That face of an angel<br />
Comes out just when you need it to<br />

As I paced back and forth all this time<br />
Cause I honestly believed in you<br />
Holding on<br />
The days drag on<br />
Stupid girl,<br />
I should have known, I should have known<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale<br />

I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,<br />
Lead her up the stairwell<br />
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,<br />
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down<br />
Now it's too late for you<br />
And your white horse, to come around<br />
<br />
Baby I was naive,<br />
Got lost in your eyes<br />

And never really had a chance<br />
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love<br />
You had to fight to have the upper hand<br />
I had so many dreams<br />
About you and me<br />
Happy endings<br />
Now I know<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />

I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale<br />
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,<br />
Lead her up the stairwell<br />
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,<br />
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down<br />
Now it's too late for you<br />
And your white horse, to come around<br />
<br />
And there you are on your knees,<br />

Begging for forgiveness, begging for me<br />
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry<br />
<br />
Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale<br />
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well<br />
This is a big world, that was a small town<br />
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now<br />
And its too late for you and your white horse<br />
Now its too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now<br />

<br />
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa<br />
Try and catch me now<br />
Oh, it's too late<br />
To catch me now
