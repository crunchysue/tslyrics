<body>It's strange to think the songs we used to sing<br />
The smiles, the flowers, everything: is gone<br />
Yesterday I found out about you<br />
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong<br />

You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance<br />
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes...<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
<br />
You should've said no, you should've gone home<br />
You should've thought twice before you let it all go<br />
You should've know that word, bout what you did with her<br />
Would get back to me...<br />
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind<br />

I shouldn't be asking myself why<br />
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...<br />
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me<br />
<br />
You can see that I've been crying<br />
And baby you know all the right things: to say<br />
But do you honestly expect me to believe<br />
We could ever be the same...<br />
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance<br />

It was a moment of weakness and you said yes...<br />
<br />
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
I can't resist... before you go, tell me this<br />
Was it worth it...<br />
Was she worth this...<br />
<br />
No... no no no...<br />
<br />
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i>
