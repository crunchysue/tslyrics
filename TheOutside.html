<body>I didn't know what I would find<br />
When I went looking for a reason, I know<br />
I didn't read between the lines<br />
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go<br />

I tried to take the road less traveled by<br />
But nothing seems to work the first few times<br />
Am I right?<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
<br />
So how can I ever try to be better?<br />
Nobody ever lets me in<br />
I can still see you, this ain't the best view<br />
On the outside looking in<br />

I've been a lot of lonely places<br />
I've never been on the outside<br />
<br />
You saw me there, but never knew<br />
I would give it all up to be<br />
A part of this, a part of you<br />
And now it's all too late so you see<br />
You could've helped if you had wanted to<br />
But no one notices until it's too<br />

Late to do anything<br />
<br />
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
So how can I ever try to be better?<br />
Nobody ever lets me in<br />
I can still see you, this ain't the best view<br />
On the outside looking in<br />
I've been a lot of lonely places<br />
I've never been on the outside
